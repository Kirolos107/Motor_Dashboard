Motor Dashboard  🚀 





⭐ Another project using an Atmega32 microcontroller. It is a motor dashboard. You can choose between two modes (DC & Stepper motors) with setting the direction of movement.





⚫Let's take a look at the operation:



- There are two modes in our projects :

     1- The first is (DC motor), you can set the direction (Clockwise or counterclockwise). 

     2- The second is (Stepper motor), you can set the direction (Clockwise or counterclockwise) and determine the rotation angle. 



- Also, after using one of these two modes, you can choose whether to restart the program or exit.







⚫Hardware Components:-

1. LCD

2. Keypad

3. DC motor

4. Stepper motor



⚫Software Layers:-

1- MCAL => DIO & PORT

2- HAL   => LCD (4 Bit Mode), Keypad, DC_Motor & STP_Motor

3- Library => STD_TYPES & BIT_MATH 







⚫Note:

- A comment explains every line in the code.

- Do not hesitate to ask for clarification on any point.
